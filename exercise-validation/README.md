# Exercise Validation

A small website to automatically check if the exercises have been successfully solved.

- Install nodejs (https://nodejs.org/en/download).
- Run `npm install` in the directory of the `package.json` file to install all dependencies.
- In the same directory, run `npm start` to host a local webserver.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5001` and select the exercise you want to validate button.
